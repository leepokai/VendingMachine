2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/RAM_reg_0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram0/RAM_reg_1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_coin1/RAM_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance ram_coin10/RAM_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.086 ns between cart_quantity_reg[8][0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and price_calc0/total_due_reg[9]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.203 ns between cart_quantity_reg[8][0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and price_calc0/total_due_reg[10]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -1.751 ns between cart_quantity_reg[8][0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and price_calc0/total_due_reg[12]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.926 ns between cart_quantity_reg[8][0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and price_calc0/total_due_reg[13]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning

There is a large setup violation of -2.052 ns between cart_quantity_reg[8][0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and price_calc0/total_due_reg[14]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
