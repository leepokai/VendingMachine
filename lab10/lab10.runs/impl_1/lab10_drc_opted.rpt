REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 paid_text_render0/char_rom/BRAM_PC_VGA_0 has an input control pin paid_text_render0/char_rom/BRAM_PC_VGA_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: paid_text_render0/char_rom/ADDR[10]) which is driven by a register (paid_text_render0/bcd_converter/bcd_hundreds_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
